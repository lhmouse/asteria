	  adjacent elements in `data` such that the first one is greater
	  than or unordered with the second one. Elements are compared

	  function call `is_sorted(data, comparator)` shall yield `true`
	  prior to this call, otherwise the effect is undefined.

	* Returns the subscript of such an element as an `integer`. This
	  function returns `lengthof(data)` if all elements are less than
	  `target`.

	* Finds the first element in `data` that is greater than `target`
	  and precedes all elements that are less than or equal to
	  `target` if any. The principle of user-defined `comparator`s is

	  function call `is_sorted(data, comparator)` shall yield `true`
	  prior to this call, otherwise the effect is undefined.

	* Returns the subscript of such an element as an `integer`. This
	  function returns `lengthof(data)` if all elements are less than
	  or equal to `target`.

	  exception will be thrown or not.

`std.array.equal_range(data, target, [comparator])`

	  `upper_bound(data, target, comparator)` respectively then
	  storing both results in an `array`.

	* Returns an `array` of two `integer`s, the first of which
	  specifies the lower bound and the other specifies the upper
	  bound.

	* Throws an exception if `data` has not been sorted properly. Be
	  advised that in this case there is no guarantee whether an
	  exception will be thrown or not.

`std.array.sort(data, [comparator])`

	* Sorts elements in `data` in ascending order. The principle of
	  user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the `is_sorted()`

	  This function returns a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Sorts elements in `data` in ascending order, then removes all
	  elements that have preceding equivalents. The principle of
	  user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the `is_sorted()`
	  function. The algorithm shall finish in `O(n log n)` time where
	  `n` is the number of elements in `data`. This function returns
	  a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Returns the sorted `array` with no duplicate elements.

	* Throws an exception if any elements are unordered. Be advised
	  that in this case there is no guarantee whether an exception
	  will be thrown or not.

`std.array.max_of(data, [comparator])`

	* Finds the maximum element in `data`. The principle of
	  user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the `is_sorted()`
	  function. Elements that are unordered with the first element

	* Returns a copy of the maximum element, or `null` if `data` is
	  empty.

`std.array.min_of(data, [comparator])`

	* Finds the minimum element in `data`. The principle of
	  user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the `is_sorted()`

	  element.

	* Returns an `array` containing all values generated.

`std.array.shuffle(data, [seed])`

	* Shuffles elements in `data` randomly. If `seed` is set to an
	  `integer`, the internal pseudo random number generator will be
	  initialized with it and will produce the same series of numbers
	  for a specific `seed` value. If it is absent, an unspecified
	  seed is generated when this function is called. This function
	  returns a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Returns the shuffled `array`.

### `std.numeric`

`std.numeric.abs(value)`

	* Gets the absolute value of `value`, which may be an `integer`
	  or `real`. Negative `integer`s are negated, which might cause
	  an exception to be thrown due to overflow. Sign bits of `real`s
	  are removed, which works on infinities and NaNs and does not
	  result in exceptions.

	* Return the absolute value.

	* Throws an exception if `value` is the `integer` `-0x1p63`.

`std.numeric.sign(value)`

	* Propagates the sign bit of the number `value`, which may be an

### `std.io`

### `std.filesystem`

`std.filesystem.get_working_directory()`

	* Gets the absolute path of the current working directory.

	* Returns a `string` containing the path to the current working
	  directory.

`std.filesystem.get_information(path)`

	* Retrieves information of the file or directory designated by
	  `path`.

	* Returns an `object` consisting of the following members (names
	  that start with `b_` are `boolean` flags; names that start with
	  `i_` are IDs as `integer`s; names that start with `n_` are
	  plain `integer`s; names that start with `t_` are timestamps in
	  UTC as `integer`s):

	  * `i_dev`   unique device id on this machine.
	  * `i_file`  unique file id on this device.
	  * `n_ref`   number of hard links to this file.
	  * `b_dir`   whether this is a directory.
	  * `b_sym`   whether this is a symbolic link.
	  * `n_size`  number of bytes this file contains.
	  * `n_ocup`  number of bytes this file occupies.
	  * `t_accs`  timestamp of last access.
	  * `t_mod`   timestamp of last modification.

	  On failure, `null` is returned.

`std.filesystem.move_from(path_new, path_old)`

	* Moves (renames) the file or directory at `path_old` to
	  `path_new`.

	* Returns `true` on success, or `null` on failure.

`std.filesystem.remove_recursive(path)`

	* Removes the file or directory at `path`. If `path` designates
	  a directory, all of its contents are removed recursively.

	* Returns the number of files and directories that have been
	  successfully removed in total, or `null` on failure.

`std.filesystem.directory_list(path)`

	* Lists the contents of the directory at `path`.

	* Returns an `object` containing all entries of the directory at
	  `path`, including the special subdirectories '.' and '..'. For
	  each element, its key specifies the filename and the value is
	  an `object` consisting of the following members (names that
	  start with `b_` are `boolean` flags; names that start with `i_`
	  are IDs as `integer`s):

	  * `b_dir`   whether this is a directory.
	  * `b_sym`   whether this is a symbolic link.

	  On failure, `null` is returned.

`std.filesystem.directory_create(path)`

	* Creates a directory at `path`. Its parent directory must exist
	  and must be accessible. This function does not fail if either
	  a directory or a symbolic link to a directory already exists on
	  `path`.

	* Returns `1` if a new directory has been created successfully,
	  `0` if the directory already exists, or `null` on failure.

`std.filesystem.directory_remove(path)`

	* Removes the directory at `path`. The directory must be empty.
	  This function fails if `path` does not designate a directory.

	* Returns `1` if the directory has been removed successfully, `0`
	  if it is not empty, or `null` on failure.

`std.filesystem.file_read(path, [offset], [limit])`

	* Reads the file at `path` in binary mode. The read operation
	  starts from the byte offset that is denoted by `offset` if it
	  is specified, or from the beginning of the file otherwise. If
	  `limit` is specified, no more than this number of bytes will be
	  read.

	* Returns the bytes that have been read as a `string`, or `null`
	  on failure.

	* Throws an exception of `offset` is negative.

`std.filesystem.file_write(path, data, [offset])`

	* Writes the file at `path` in binary mode. The write operation
	  starts from the byte offset that is denoted by `offset` if it
	  is specified, or from the beginning of the file otherwise. The
	  file is truncated to this length before the write operation;
	  any existent contents after the write point are discarded. This
	  function fails if the data can only be written partially.

	* Returns `true` if all data have been written successfully, or
	  `null` on failure.

	* Throws an exception of `offset` is negative.

`std.filesystem.file_append(path, data, [exclusive])`

	* Writes the file at `path` in binary mode. The write operation
	  starts from the end of the file; existent contents of the file
	  are left intact. If `exclusive` is `true` and a file exists on
	  `path`, this function fails. This function also fails if the
	  data can only be written partially.

	* Returns `true` if all data have been written successfully, or
	  `null` on failure.

`std.filesystem.file_copy_from(path_new, path_old)`

	* Copies the file `path_old` to `path_new`. If `path_old` is a
	  symbolic link, it is the target that will be copied, rather
	  than the symbolic link itself. This function fails if
	  `path_old` designates a directory.

	* Returns `true` on success, or `null` on failure.

`std.filesystem.file_remove(path)`

	* Removes the file at `path`. This function fails if `path`
	  designates a directory.

	* Returns `true` if the file has been removed successfully, or
	  `null` on failure.
