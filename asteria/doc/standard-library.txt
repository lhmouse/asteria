### `std.version`

`std.version.major`

	* Denotes the major version number of the standard library that
	  has been enabled. This member is always set, even when there is
	  no standard library.

`std.version.minor`

	* Denotes the minor version number of the standard library that
	  has been enabled. This member is always set, even when there is
	  no standard library.

### `std.gc`

`std.gc.tracked_count(generation)`

	* Gets the number of variables that are being tracked by the
	  the collector for `generation`. Valid values for `generation`
	  are `0`, `1` and `2`. This value is only informative.

	* Returns the number of variables being tracked. If `generation`
	  is not valid, `null` is returned.

`std.gc.get_threshold(generation)`

	  unspecified positive `integer`; overlarge values are capped
	  silently without failure. A larger `threshold` makes garbage
	  collection run less often but slower. Setting `threshold` to
	  `0` ensures all unreachable variables be collected immediately.

	* Decodes data encoded in base64, as specified by IETF RFC 4648.
	  Whitespaces can be used to delimit encoding units; they shall
	  not occur between characters in the same unit. Consequently,
	  the number of non-whitespace characters must be a multiple of
	  four. Invalid characters cause parse errors.

	* Returns a `string` containing decoded bytes. If `text` is empty
	  or consists of only whitespaces, an empty `string` is returned.
	  In the case of parse errors, `null` is returned.

`std.string.translate(text, inputs, [outputs])`

	* Performs bytewise translation on the given string. For every
	  byte in `text` that is also found in `inputs`, if there is a
	  corresponding replacement byte in `outputs` with the same
	  subscript, it is replaced with the latter; if no replacement
	  exists, because `outputs` is shorter than `inputs` or is null,
	  it is deleted. If `outputs` is longer than `inputs`, excess
	  bytes are ignored. Bytes that do not exist in `inputs` are left
	  intact. This function returns a new `string` without modifying
	  `text`.

	* Returns the translated `string`.

`std.string.utf8_encode(code_points, [permissive])`

	* Encodes code points from `code_points` into an UTF-8 `string`.
	  `code_points` can be either an `integer` or an `array` of
	  `integer`s. When an invalid code point is encountered, if
	  `permissive` is set to `true`, it is replaced with the
	  replacement character `"\uFFFD"` and consequently encoded as
	  `"\xEF\xBF\xBD"`; otherwise this function fails.

	* Returns the encoded `string` on success, or `null` otherwise.

`std.string.utf8_decode(text, [permissive])`

	* Decodes `text`, which is expected to be a `string` containing
	  UTF-8 code units, into an `array` of code points, represented
	  as `integer`s. When an invalid code sequence is encountered, if
	  `permissive` is set to `true`, all code units of it are
	  re-interpreted as isolated bytes according to ISO/IEC 8859-1;
	  otherwise this function fails.

	* Returns an `array` containing decoded code points, or `null`
	  otherwise.

	  function call `is_sorted(data, comparator)` shall yield `true`
	  prior to this call, otherwise the effect is undefined.

	* Returns the subscript of such an element as an `integer`. This
	  function returns `lengthof(data)` if all elements are less than

	* Finds the first element in `data` that is greater than `target`
	  and precedes all elements that are less than or equal to
	  `target` if any. The principle of user-defined `comparator`s is

	  function call `is_sorted(data, comparator)` shall yield `true`
	  prior to this call, otherwise the effect is undefined.

	* Returns the subscript of such an element as an `integer`. This
	  function returns `lengthof(data)` if all elements are less than
	  or equal to `target`.

	* Throws an exception if `data` has not been sorted properly. Be
	  advised that in this case there is no guarantee whether an
	  exception will be thrown or not.

`std.array.equal_range(data, target, [comparator])`

	* Gets the range of elements equivalent to `target` in `data` as
	  a single function call. This function is equivalent to calling
	  `lower_bound(data, target, comparator)` and
	  `upper_bound(data, target, comparator)` respectively then
	  storing both results in an `array`.

	* Returns an `array` of two `integer`s, the first of which
	  specifies the lower bound and the other specifies the upper
	  bound.

	* Throws an exception if `data` has not been sorted properly. Be
	  advised that in this case there is no guarantee whether an
	  exception will be thrown or not.

`std.array.sort(data, [comparator])`

	* Sorts elements in `data` in ascending order. The principle of
	  user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the `is_sorted()`
	  function. The algorithm shall finish in `O(n log n)` time where
	  `n` is the number of elements in `data`, and shall be stable.
	  This function returns a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Returns the sorted `array`.

	* Throws an exception if any elements are unordered. Be advised
	  that in this case there is no guarantee whether an exception
	  will be thrown or not.

`std.array.sortu(data, [comparator])`

	* Sorts elements in `data` in ascending order, then removes all
	  elements that have preceding equivalents. The principle of
	  user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the `is_sorted()`
	  function. The algorithm shall finish in `O(n log n)` time where
	  `n` is the number of elements in `data`. This function returns
	  a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Returns the sorted `array` with no duplicate elements.

	* Throws an exception if any elements are unordered. Be advised
	  that in this case there is no guarantee whether an exception
	  will be thrown or not.

`std.array.max_of(data, [comparator])`

	* Finds the maximum element in `data`. The principle of
	  user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the `is_sorted()`
	  function. Elements that are unordered with the first element
	  are ignored silently.

	* Returns a copy of the maximum element, or `null` if `data` is
	  empty.

`std.array.min_of(data, [comparator])`

	* Finds the minimum element in `data`. The principle of
	  user-defined `comparator`s is the same as the `is_sorted()`

	  empty.

	  element.

	* Returns an `array` containing all values generated.

`std.array.shuffle(data, [seed])`

	* Shuffles elements in `data` randomly. If `seed` is set to an
	  `integer`, the internal pseudo random number generator will be
	  initialized with it and will produce the same series of numbers
	  for a specific `seed` value. If it is absent, an unspecified
	  seed is generated when this function is called. This function
	  returns a new `array` without modifying `data`.

	* Returns the shuffled `array`.

`std.array.copy_keys([source])`

	* Copies all keys from `source`, which shall be an `object`, to
	  create an `array`.

`std.numeric.abs(value)`

	* Gets the absolute value of `value`, which may be an `integer`
	  or `real`. Negative `integer`s are negated, which might cause

	  multiplying `frac` with `pow(2,exp)`. `exp` shall be of type
	  `integer`. This function is the inverse of `frexp()`.

	* Returns the product as a `real`.

`std.numeric.addm(x, y)`

	* Adds `y` to `x` using modular arithmetic. `x` and `y` must be
	  of the `integer` type. The result is reduced to be congruent to
	  the sum of `x` and `y` modulo `0x1p64` in infinite precision.
	  This function will not cause overflow exceptions to be thrown.

	* Returns the reduced sum of `x` and `y`.

`std.numeric.subm(x, y)`

	* Subtracts `y` from `x` using modular arithmetic. `x` and `y`

	  infinite precision. This function will not cause overflow
	  exceptions to be thrown.

	* Returns the reduced product of `x` and `y`.

`std.numeric.adds(x, y)`

	* Adds `y` to `x` using saturating arithmetic. `x` and `y` may be
	  `integer` or `real` values. The result is limited within the
	  range of representable values of its type, hence will not cause
	  overflow exceptions to be thrown. When either argument is of
	  type `real` which supports infinities, this function is
	  equivalent to the built-in addition operator.

	* Returns the saturated sum of `x` and `y`.

`std.numeric.subs(x, y)`

	* Subtracts `y` from `x` using saturating arithmetic. `x` and `y`
	  may be `integer` or `real` values. The result is limited within
	  the range of representable values of its type, hence will not

	  of type `real` which supports infinities, this function is
	  equivalent to the built-in subtraction operator.

	* Returns the saturated difference of `x` and `y`.

	* Multiplies `x` by `y` using saturating arithmetic. `x` and `y`
	  may be `integer` or `real` values. The result is limited within
	  the range of representable values of its type, hence will not
	  cause overflow exceptions to be thrown. When either argument is

	* Counts the number of one bits in `x`, which shall be of type
	  `integer`.

	* Returns the bit count as an `integer`.

`std.numeric.format(value, [base], [ebase])`

	* Converts an `integer` or `real` to a `string` in `base`. This
	  function writes as many digits as possible to ensure precision.
	  No plus sign precedes the significant figures. If `base` is
	  absent, `10` is assumed. If `ebase` is specified, an exponent
	  is appended to the significand as follows: If `value` is of
	  type `integer`, the significand is kept as short as possible;
	  otherwise (when `value` is of type `real`), it is written in
	  scientific notation. In both cases, the exponent comprises at
	  least two digits with an explicit sign. If `ebase` is absent,
	  no exponent appears. The result is exact as long as `base` is a
	  power of two.

	* Returns a `string` converted from `value`.

	* Throws an exception if `base` is neither `2` nor `10` nor `16`,
	  or if `ebase` is neither `2` nor `10`, or if `base` is not `10`
	  but `ebase` is `10`.

`std.numeric.parse_integer(text)`

	* Parses `text` for an `integer`. `text` shall be a `string`. All
	  leading and trailing blank characters are stripped from `text`.
	  If it becomes empty, this function fails; otherwise, it shall
	  match one of the following Perl regular expressions, ignoring
	  case of characters:

	  * Binary (base-2):
	    `[+-]?0b([01]`?)+[ep][+]?([0-9]`?)+`
	  * Hexadecimal (base-16):
	    `[+-]?0x([0-9a-f]`?)+[ep][+]?([0-9]`?)+`
	  * Decimal (base-10):
	    `[+-]?([0-9]`?)+[ep][+]?([0-9]`?)+`

	  If the string does not match any of the above, this function
	  fails. If the result is outside the range of representable
	  values of type `integer`, this function fails.

	* Returns the `integer` value converted from `text`. On failure,
	  `null` is returned.

`std.numeric.parse_real(text, [saturating])`

	* Parses `text` for a `real`. `text` shall be a `string`. All
	  leading and trailing blank characters are stripped from `text`.
	  If it becomes empty, this function fails; otherwise, it shall
	  match any of the following Perl regular expressions, ignoring
	  case of characters:

	  * Infinities:
	    `[+-]?infinity`
	  * NaNs:
	    `[+-]?nan`
	  * Binary (base-2):
	    `[+-]?0b([01]`?)+(\.([01]`?))?[ep][-+]?([0-9]`?)+`
	  * Hexadecimal (base-16):
	    `[+-]?0x([0-9a-f]`?)+(\.([0-9a-f]`?))?[ep][-+]?([0-9]`?)+`
	  * Decimal (base-10):
	    `[+-]?([0-9]`?)+(\.([0-9]`?))?[ep][-+]?([0-9]`?)+`

	  If the string does not match any of the above, this function
	  fails. If the absolute value of the result is too small to fit
	  in a `real`, a signed zero is returned. When the absolute value
	  is too large, if `saturating` is set to `true`, a signed
	  infinity is returned; otherwise this function fails.

	* Returns the `real` value converted from `text`. On failure,
	  `null` is returned.

	  if it is not empty, or `null` on failure.

`std.filesystem.file_read(path, [offset], [limit])`

	* Reads the file at `path` in binary mode. The read operation
	  starts from the byte offset that is denoted by `offset` if it

	  `function` whose first argument is the absolute offset of the
	  data block that has been read, and whose second argument is the
	  bytes read and stored in a `string`. Data may be transferred in
	  multiple blocks of variable sizes; the caller shall make no
	  assumption about the number of times that `callback` will be
	  called or the size of each individual block. The read operation
	  starts from the byte offset that is denoted by `offset` if it
	  is specified, or from the beginning of the file otherwise. If
	  `limit` is specified, no more than this number of bytes will be
	  read.

	  `null` on failure.

	* Throws an exception if `offset` is negative.

`std.filesystem.file_write(path, data, [offset])`

	  starts from the byte offset that is denoted by `offset` if it
	  is specified, or from the beginning of the file otherwise. The
	  file is truncated to this length before the write operation;
	  any existent contents after the write point are discarded. This
	  function fails if the data can only be written partially.

	  `null` on failure.

	* Throws an exception if `offset` is negative.

`std.filesystem.file_append(path, data, [exclusive])`

	* Writes the file at `path` in binary mode. The write operation
	  starts from the end of the file; existent contents of the file
	  are left intact. If `exclusive` is `true` and a file exists on
	  `path`, this function fails. This function also fails if the
	  data can only be written partially.

	  `null` on failure.

`std.filesystem.file_copy_from(path_new, path_old)`

	* Copies the file `path_old` to `path_new`. If `path_old` is a
	  symbolic link, it is the target that will be copied, rather
	  than the symbolic link itself. This function fails if
	  `path_old` designates a directory.

	* Returns `true` on success, or `null` on failure.

`std.filesystem.file_remove(path)`

	* Removes the file at `path`. This function fails if `path`
	  designates a directory.

	* Returns `true` if the file has been removed successfully, or
	  `null` on failure.

	  members:

	  * `write(data)`
	  * `finish()`

	  The function `write()` is used to put data into the hasher,
	  which shall be of type `string`. After all data have been put,
	  the function `finish()` extracts the checksum as an `integer`

	  hasher, making it suitable for further data as if it had just
	  been created.

`std.checksum.crc32(data)`

	* Calculates the CRC-32 checksum of `data` which must be of type

	  members:

	  * `write(data)`
	  * `finish()`

	  The function `write()` is used to put data into the hasher,
	  which shall be of type `string`. After all data have been put,
	  the function `finish()` extracts the checksum as an `integer`

	  hasher, making it suitable for further data as if it had just
	  been created.

`std.checksum.fnv1a32(data)`

	* Calculates the 32-bit FNV-1a checksum of `data` which must be

	  making it suitable for further data as if it had just been
	  created.

`std.checksum.md5(data)`

	* Calculates the MD5 checksum of `data` which must be of type
	  `string`, as if this function was defined as

	      h.write(data);
	      return h.finish();
	    };
	  ```

	  in uppercase.

`std.checksum.sha1_new()`

	      h.write(data);
	      return h.finish();
	    };

	  members:

	  * `write(data)`

	  digits in uppercase.

### `std.json`

`std.json.format(value, [indent])`

	* Converts a value to a `string` in the JSON format, according to
	  IETF RFC 7159. This function generates text that conforms to
	  JSON strictly; values whose types cannot be represented in JSON
	  are discarded if they are found in an `object` and censored to
	  `null` otherwise. If `indent` is set to a `string`, it is used
	  as each level of indention following a line break, unless it is
	  empty, in which case no line break is inserted. If `indent` is
	  set to an `integer`, it is clamped between `0` and `10`
	  inclusively and this function behaves as if a `string`
	  consisting of this number of spaces was set. Its default value
	  is an empty `string`.

	* Returns the formatted text as a `string`.

`std.json.parse(text)`

	* Parses a `string` containing data encoded in the JSON format
	  and converts it to a value. This function reuses the tokenizer

	  are also supported by JSON5:

	  * Single-line and multiple-line comments are allowed.
	  * Binary and hexadecimal numbers are allowed.
	  * Numbers can have binary exponents.
	  * Infinities and NaNs are allowed.
	  * Numbers can start with plus signs.
	  * Strings and object keys may be single-quoted.
	  * Escape sequences (including UTF-32) are allowed in strings.
	  * Element lists of arrays and objects may end in commas.
	  * Object keys may be unquoted if they are valid identifiers.

	  Be advised that numbers are always parsed as `real`s.

	* Returns the parsed value. If `text` is empty or is not a valid
	  JSON string, `null` is returned. There is no way to tell empty
	  or explicit `"null"` inputs from failures.
