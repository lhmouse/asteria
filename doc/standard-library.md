# Asteria Standard Library

All standard library components are to be accessed through the global `std`
variable. Individual components are categorized into sub-objects.

## `std.version`

### `std.version.major`

* Denotes the major version number of the standard library that has been
  enabled. This field is always set, even when there is no standard library.

### `std.version.minor`

* Denotes the minor version number of the standard library that has been
  enabled. This field is always set, even when there is no standard library.

## `std.gc`

### `std.gc.count_variables(generation)`

* Gets the number of variables that are being tracked by the collector for
  `generation`. Valid values for `generation` are `0`, `1` and `2`.

* Returns the number of tracked variables as an integer. This value is only
  informative.

* Throws an exception if `generation` is out of range.

### `std.gc.get_threshold(generation)`

* Gets the threshold of the collector for `generation`. Valid values for
  `generation` are `0`, `1` and `2`.

* Returns the threshold as an integer.

* Throws an exception if `generation` is out of range.

### `std.gc.set_threshold(generation, threshold)`

* Sets the threshold of the collector for `generation` to `threshold`. Valid
  values for `generation` are `0`, `1` and `2`. Valid values for `threshold`
  range from `0` to an unspecified positive integer; overlarge values will
  be capped silently without failure. Larger `threshold` values make garbage
  collection run less often, but slower. Setting `threshold` to `0` ensures
  all unreachable variables be collected immediately.

* Returns the threshold before the call, as an integer.

* Throws an exception if `generation` is out of range.

### `std.gc.collect([generation_limit])`

* Performs garbage collection on all generations including and up to
  `generation_limit`. If it is absent, all generations are collected. The
  garbage collector is unable to collect local variables that are still in
  the caller scope.

* Returns the number of variables that have been collected in total.

## `std.system`

### `std.system.get_environment_variable(name)`

* Retrieves an environment variable with `name`.

* Returns the environment variable as a string if one is found, or `null` if
  no such variable exists.

### `std.system.get_environment_variables()`

* Retrieves all environment variables as an object.

* Returns an object of all environment variables.

### `std.system.get_properties()`

* Retrieves properties about the running operating system.

* Returns an object consisting of the following fields:

  * `os`       string: name of the operating system
  * `kernel`   string: name and release of the kernel
  * `arch`     string: name of the CPU architecture
  * `nprocs`   integer: number of active CPU cores

### `std.system.uuid()`

* Generates a UUID of the form `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-Myyy-Nzzz-wwwwwwwwwwww`, where

  * x: number of 1/30518 seconds since UNIX Epoch
  * M: always `4` (UUID version)
  * y: process ID
  * N: any of `0`-`7` (UUID variant)
  * z: context ID
  * w: random bytes

  Unlike version-1 UUIDs in RFC 4122, the timestamp is written in big-endian
  byte order. This ensures the (case-insensitive) lexicographical ordering of
  such UUIDs match their order of creation. Hexadecimal digits above nine are
  encoded as capital letters.

* Returns a UUID as a string of 36 characters, without braces.

### `std.system.get_pid()`

* Gets the ID of the current process.

* Returns the current process ID as an integer.

### `std.system.get_ppid()`

* Gets the ID of the parent process.

* Returns the parent process ID as an integer.

### `std.system.get_uid()`

* Gets the real user ID of the current process.

* Returns the real user ID as an integer.

### `std.system.get_euid()`

* Gets the effective user ID of the current process.

* Returns the effective user ID as an integer.

### `std.system.call(cmd, [argv], [envp])`

* Launches the program denoted by `cmd`, awaits its termination, and returns
  its exit status. If `argv` is provided, it shall be an array of strings,
  which specifies additional arguments to pass to the program. If `envp` is
  given, it shall also be an array of strings, which specifies environment
  variables to the program.

* Returns the exit status of the new process as an integer. If the process
  has exited due to a signal, the exit status is `128+N` where `N` is the
  signal number.

* Throws an exception if the program could not be launched or its exit status
  could not be retrieved.

### `std.system.daemonize()`

* Detaches the current process from its controlling terminal and continues
  execution in the background. The calling process terminates on success so
  this function never returns.

* Throws an exception upon failure.

### `std.system.sleep(duration)`

* Suspends execution for `duration` milliseconds, which may be either an
  integer or real number. If `duration` is not a non-negative number, this
  function returns immediately.

* Returns the remaining time in milliseconds as a real number, which will be
  positive only if the sleep has been interrupted.

### `std.system.load_conf(path)`

* Loads the configuration file denoted by `path`. Its syntax is similar to
  JSON5, except that commas, semicolons and top-level braces are omitted for
  simplicity, and single-quoted strings do not allow escapes. [Here is a
  sample.](sample.conf)

* Returns an object of the file, if it has been parsed successfully.

* Throws an exception if the file cannot be opened or contains an error.

## `std.debug`

### `std.debug.logf(templ, ...)`

* Composee a string in the same way as `std.string.format()`, but instead of
  returning it, writes it to standard error. A line break is appended to
  terminate the line.

* Returns the number of bytes written if the operation succeeds, or `null`
  otherwise.

* Throws an exception if `templ` is not a valid format string.

### `std.debug.dump([value], [indent])`

* Prints the value to standard error with detailed information. `indent`
  specifies the number of spaces, clamped between `0` and `10`, to use for
  each level of indention. If it is set to `0`, no line break is inserted
  and output lines are not indented. Its default value is `2`.

* Returns the number of bytes written if the operation succeeds, or `null`
  otherwise.

## `std.chrono`

### `std.chrono.now()`

* Retrieves the wall clock time.

* Returns the number of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`,
  represented as an integer.

### `std.chrono.format(time_point, [with_ms], [utc_offset])`

* Converts `time_point`, which shall be an integer representing the number
  of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`, to a string in the
  modified ISO 8601 format, which uses

  * a space instead of the T date/time delimiter
  * a space between time and time zone
  * no colon between hours and minutes of the timezone

  If `with_ms` is set to `true`, the string will have a 3-digit decimal part
  for milliseconds. `utc_offset` specifies the number of minutes of local
  time ahead of UTC time, as an integer. If it is absent, it is obtained from
  the local system.

* Returns a string representing the time point.

### `std.chrono.parse(time_str)`

* Parses `time_str`, which shall be a string representing a time point in
  the modified ISO 8601 format, as the result of `format()`. The decimal
  part is optional and may have fewer or more digits. The timezone part may
  be `"UTC"` or `"GMT"` for UTC, or an explicit value such as `"+0400"`. If
  it is absent, the time is assumed to be in the local time zone. Leading or
  trailing spaces are allowed.

* Returns the number of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC`, as an
  integer.

* Throws an exception if the string is invalid.

### `std.chrono.hires_now()`

* Retrieves a time point from a high resolution clock, which shall go
  monotonically and cannot be adjusted. The result is guaranteed accuracy and
  is suitable for time measurement.

* Returns the number of milliseconds since an unspecified time point, as a
  real number.

### `std.chrono.steady_now()`

* Retrieves a time point from a steady clock, which shall go monotonically
  and cannot be adjusted.

* Returns the number of milliseconds since an unspecified time point, as an
  integer.

## `std.string`

### `std.string.slice(text, from, [length])`

* Copies a subrange of `text` to create a new byte string. Bytes are copied
  from `from` if it is non-negative, or from `countof text + from` otherwise.
  If `length` is set to an integer, no more than this number of bytes will be
  copied. If it is absent, all bytes from `from` to the end of `text` will be
  copied. If `from` is outside `text`, an empty string is returned.

* Returns the specified substring of `text`.

### `std.string.replace_slice(text, from, [length], replacement, [rfrom, [rlength]])`

* Replaces a subrange of `text` with `replacement` to create a new byte
  string. `from` specifies the start of the subrange to replace. If `from` is
  negative, it specifies an offset from the end of `text`. `length` specifies
  the maximum number of bytes to replace. If it is set to `null`, all bytes
  up to the end of `text` will be replaced. If `rfrom` is specified, the
  replacement string is determined as `slice(replacement, rfrom, rlength)`.
  This function returns a new string without modifying `text`.

* Returns a string with the subrange replaced.

### `std.string.compare(text1, text2, [length])`

* Performs lexicographical comparison on two byte strings. If `length` is set
  to an integer, no more than this number of bytes will be compared. This
  function behaves like the `strncmp()` function in C, except that null
  characters are considered parts of strings.

  negative integer if `text1` compares less than `text2`, or zero if `text1`
  compares equal to `text2`.

### `std.string.starts_with(text, prefix)`

  of any string.

* Returns `true` if `prefix` is a prefix of `text`, or `false` otherwise.

### `std.string.ends_with(text, suffix)`

* Checks whether `suffix` is a suffix of `text`. An empty string is a suffix
  of any string.

* Returns `true` if `suffix` is a suffix of `text`, or `false` otherwise.

### `std.string.find(text, [from, [length]], pattern)`

* Searches `text` for the first occurrence of `pattern`. The search operation
  is performed on the same subrange that would have been returned by
  `slice(text, from, length)`.

  not contain `pattern`, it is returned intact.

### `std.string.find_any_of(text, [from, [length]], accept)`

* Searches `text` for the first byte that exists in `accept`. The search
  operation is performed on the same subrange that would have been returned
  by `slice(text, from, length)`.

* Reverses a byte string. This function returns a new string without
  modifying `text`.

* Returns the reversed string.

### `std.string.trim(text, [reject])`

* Removes the longest prefix and suffix consisting of bytes from `reject`. If
  `reject` is empty, no byte will be removed. The default value of `reject`
  comprises a space and a tab. This function returns a new string without
  modifying `text`.

* Returns the trimmed string.

### `std.string.triml(text, [reject])`

  returns a new string without modifying `text`.

* Returns the padded string.

* Throws an exception if `padding` is empty.

### `std.string.padr(text, length, [padding])`

### `std.string.translate(text, inputs, [outputs])`

* Performs bytewise translation on the given string. For every byte in `text`
  that is found in `inputs`, if there is a corresponding replacement byte in
  `outputs` at the same subscript, it is replaced with the latter; if no such
  replacement exists, because `outputs` either is shorter than `inputs` or is
  null, it is deleted. If `outputs` is longer than `inputs`, excess bytes are
  ignored. This function returns a new string without modifying `text`.

* Returns the translated string.

### `std.string.explode(text, [delim, [limit]])`

* Breaks `text` down into segments, separated by `delim`. If `delim` is an
  empty string or absent, every byte will become a segment. If `limit` is set
  to a positive integer, there will be no more segments than this number; the
  last segment will contain all remaining bytes from `text`.

* Returns broken-down segments as an array. If `text` is empty, an empty
  array is returned.

* Throws an exception if `limit` is negative or zero.

### `std.string.implode(segments, [delim])`

* Concatenates `segments`, which shall be an array of strings, to create a
  long string. If `delim` is specified, it is inserted between adjacent

* Decodes data encoded in the base32 encoding, specified by [RFC 4648](
  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648.html). Whitespace can be used to
  delimit encoding units, but it shall not occur between characters in the
  same encoding unit. The total number of non-whitespace characters must be a
  multiple of eight.

  always a multiple of four. Padding characters are mandatory.

* Returns the encoded string.

### `std.string.base64_decode(text)`

* Decodes data encoded in the base64 encoding, specified by [RFC 4648](
  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4648.html). Whitespace can be used to
  delimit encoding units, but it shall not occur between characters in the
  same encoding unit. The total number of non-whitespace characters must be a
  multiple of four.

* Returns decoded bytes as a string. If `text` is empty or comprises only
  whitespaces, an empty string is returned.

* Throws an exception if `text` is invalid.

### `std.string.url_encode(data)`

* Encodes bytes in `data` according to the URI syntax, specified by [RFC
  3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html). Every byte that is not
  a letter, digit, `-`, `.`, `_` or `~` is encoded as a `%` followed by two
  hexadecimal digits. Hexadecimal digits above nine are encoded as capital
  letters.

* Returns the encoded string. If `data` is empty, an empty string is
  returned.

### `std.string.url_decode(text)`

* Decodes percent-encode sequences from `text` and converts them to bytes,
  according to the URI syntax, specified by [RFC 3986](
  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html). For convenience reasons, both
  reserved and unreserved characters are copied verbatim. Characters that are
  neither reserved nor unreserved (such as control characters and non-ASCII
  characters) cause decode errors.

* Returns decoded bytes as a string.

* Throws an exception if the string contains invalid characters.

### `std.string.url_query_encode(data)`

* Encodes bytes in `data` according to the URI syntax, specified by [RFC
  3986](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html). This function encodes
  fewer characters than `url_encode()`. A space is encoded as `+` instead of
  the long form `%20`.

* Returns the encoded string. If `data` is empty, an empty string is
  returned.

### `std.string.url_query_decode(text)`

* Decodes percent-encode sequences from `text` and converts them to bytes,
  according to the URI syntax, specified by [RFC 3986](
  https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3986.html). For convenience reasons, both
  reserved and unreserved characters are copied verbatim. `+` is decoded as
  a space. Characters that are neither reserved nor unreserved (such as
  control characters and non-ASCII characters) cause decode errors.

* Throws an exception if the string contains invalid characters.

### `std.string.utf8_validate(text)`

* Checks whether `text` is a valid UTF-8 string.

* Returns `true` if `text` is valid, or `false` otherwise.

### `std.string.utf8_encode(code_points, [permissive])`

* Encodes code points from `code_points` into a UTF-8 string. `code_points`
  can be either an integer or an array of integers. When an invalid code
  point is encountered, if `permissive` is set to `true`, it is replaced with
  the replacement character `"\uFFFD"` and encoded as `"\xEF\xBF\xBD"`;
  otherwise this function fails.

* Returns the encoded string.

* Throws an exception on failure.

### `std.string.utf8_decode(text, [permissive])`

* Decodes the UTF-8 string, `text`, into UTF code points, represented as an
  array of integers. When an invalid code sequence is encountered, if
  `permissive` is set to `true`, all its code units are re-interpreted as
  isolated bytes according to ISO/IEC 8859-1; otherwise this function fails.

* Returns an array containing decoded code points.

* Throws an exception on failure.

### `std.string.format(templ, ...)`

* Composes a string according to the template string `templ`, where

  * `$$` is replaced with a literal `$`.
  * `${NNN}`, where `NNN` is at most three decimal numerals, is replaced
       with the NNN-th argument. If `NNN` is  zero, it is replaced with
       `templ` itself.
  * `$N`, where `N` is a single decimal numeral, is the same as `${N}`.
  * All the other characters are copied verbatim.

* Returns the composed string.

* Throws an exception if `templ` contains invalid placeholder sequences.

### `std.string.PCRE(pattern, [options])`

* Constructs a string matcher object from the Perl-compatible regular
  expression (PCRE) `pattern`. If `options` is set, it shall be an array of
  strings, whose elements specify options for the regular expression (this
  list is partly copied from the PCRE2 manual):

  * `"caseless"`    Do caseless matching
  * `"dotall"`      `.` matches anything including new lines
  * `"extended"`    Ignore whitespace and `#` comments
  * `"multiline"`   `^` and `$` match newlines within data

* Returns a matcher as an object consisting of the following fields:

  * `find(text, [from, [length]])`
  * `match(text, [from, [length]])`
  * `named_match(text, [from, [length]])`
  * `replace(text, [from, [length]], replacement)`

  These functions behave the same way as their counterparts with the `pcre_`
  prefix, as described in this document.

* Throws an exception if `pattern` is not a valid PCRE.

### `std.string.pcre_find(text, [from, [length]], pattern, [options])`

* Searches `text` for the first match of `pattern`. The search operation is
  performed on the same subrange that would have been returned by
  `slice(text, from, length)`. `options` specifies the options to pass to
  `PCRE(pattern, options)`.

* Returns an array of two integers. The first integer specifies the subscript
  of the matching sequence, and the second integer specifies its length. If
  `pattern` is not found, this function returns `null`.

* Throws an exception if `pattern` is not a valid PCRE.

### `std.string.pcre_match(text, [from, [length]], pattern, [options])`

* Searches `text` for the first match of `pattern`. The search operation is
  performed on the same subrange that would have been returned by
  `slice(text, from, length)`. `options` specifies options to pass to
  `PCRE(pattern, options)`.

* Returns an array of strings. The first element is a copy of the substring
  that matches `pattern`, and the remaining elements are substrings that
  match positional capturing groups. If a group fails to match, its
  corresponding element is `null`. If `text` does not match `pattern`, `null`
  is returned.

* Throws an exception if `pattern` is not a valid PCRE.

### `std.string.pcre_named_match(text, [from, [length]], pattern, [options])`

* Searches `text` for the first match of `pattern`. The search operation is
  performed on the same subrange that would have been returned by
  `slice(text, from, length)`. `options` specifies options to pass to
  `PCRE(pattern, options)`.

* Returns an object of all named groups. Each key is the name of a group and
  its value is the matched substring, if any. If there is no named group in
  `pattern`, an empty object is returned. If a group fails to match, its
  corresponding value is `null`. If `text` does not match `pattern`, `null`
  is returned.

* Throws an exception if `pattern` is not a valid PCRE.

### `std.string.pcre_replace(text, [from, [length]], pattern, replacement, [options])`

* Searches `text` for `pattern` and replaces all matches with `replacement`.
  The search operation is performed on the same subrange that would have been
  returned by `slice(text, from, length)`. `options` specifies options to
  pass to `PCRE(pattern, options)`. This function returns a new string
  without modifying `text`.

* Returns the string with `pattern` replaced. If `text` does not contain
  `pattern`, it is returned intact.

* Throws an exception if `pattern` is not a valid PCRE.

### `std.string.iconv(to_encoding, text, [from_encoding])`

  wrapper for the iconv library, and accepts the same set of encoding names.
  The default value of `from_encoding` is `"UTF-8"`.

* Returns the converted byte string.

* Throws an exception in case of an invalid encoding or an invalid input
  string.

## `std.array`

### `std.array.slice(data, from, [length])`

* Copies a subrange of `data` to create a new array. Elements are copied from
  `from` if it is non-negative, or from `countof data + from` otherwise. If
  `length` is set to an integer, no more than this number of elements will be
  copied. If it is absent, all elements from `from` to the end of `data` will
  be copied. If `from` is outside `data`, an empty array is returned.

* Returns the specified subarray of `data`.

### `std.array.replace_slice(data, from, [length], replacement, [rfrom, [rlength]])`

* Replaces a subrange of `data` with `replacement` to create a new array.
  `from` specifies the start of the subrange to replace. If `from` is
  negative, it specifies an offset from the end of `data`. `length` denotes
  the maximum number of elements to replace. If it is set to `null`, all
  elements up to the end will be replaced. If `rfrom` is specified, the
  replacement array is determined as `slice(replacement, rfrom, rlength)`.
  This function returns a new array without modifying `data`.

* Returns a new array with the subrange replaced.

### `std.array.find(data, [from, [length]], [target])`

* Searches `data` for the first element `x`, for which either `target` is a
  function and `target(x)` is true, or `target` is not a function and
  `x == target` is true. The search operation is performed on the same
  subrange that would have been returned by `slice(data, from, length)`.

* Returns the subscript as an integer if a match is found, or `null`
  otherwise.

### `std.array.find_not(data, [from, [length]], [target])`

* Searches `data` for the first element `x`, for which either`target` is a
  function and `target(x)` is false, or `target` is not a function and
  `x == target` is false. The search operation is performed on the same
  subrange that would have been returned by `slice(data, from, length)`.

* Gets the range of elements equivalent to `target` in `data` as a single
  function call. This function is a more efficient implementation of `[
  lower_bound(data, target, comparator), upper_bound(data, target,
  comparator) - lower_bound(data, target, comparator) ]`.

* Returns an array of two integers, the first of which specifies the lower
  bound and the second of which specifies the difference from the lower bound

      });
  };
  ```

* Returns sorted key-value pairs, as an array of two-element arrays.

### `std.array.max_of(data, [comparator])`

  bits, then filling the vacuum in the right with the last `n` bits that have
  just been shifted out. `n` is modulo `m` so rotating by a negative count to

  bits, then filling the vacuum in the left with the last `n` bits that have
  just been shifted out. `n` is modulo `m` so rotating by a negative count to
  the right is equivalent to rotating by its absolute value to the left. All
  the other bits are zeroed.

* Returns the rotated value as an integer. If `m` is zero, zero is returned.

* Throws an exception if `m` is negative or greater than `64`.

### `std.numeric.format(value, [base, [ebase]])`

* Converts an integer or real number to a string, where the significand is in
  `base` and the exponent is in `ebase`. This function writes as many digits
  as necessary to avoid a precision loss. The default value of `base` is ten.
  If `ebase` is absent, no exponent will be emitted. If `ebase` is specified,
  an exponent is appended to the significand as follows: If `value` is an
  integer, the significand is kept as short as possible; otherwise (when it
  is a real number), it is written in scientific notation; in both cases, the
  exponent comprises at least two digits with an explicit sign. The result is
  exact as long as `base` is a power of two.

* Returns a numeric string converted from `value`.

* Throws an exception if `base` is neither `2` nor `10` nor `16`, or if
  `ebase` is not `10` for decimal, or if `ebase` is not `2` for binary or
  hexadecimal.

### `std.numeric.parse(text)`

* Parses `text` for a number. `text` shall be a string. Leading and trailing
  blank characters are ignored. If the string is empty, this function fails;
  otherwise, it shall match one of the following regular expressions:

  * infinity:     `[+-]?infinity`
  * NaN:          `[+-]?nan`
  * decimal:      `[+-]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?`
  * binary:       `[+-]?0[bB][01]+(\.[01]+)?([eE][-+]?[0-9]+)?`
  * hexadecimal:  `[+-]?0x[0-9a-fA-F]+(\.[0-9a-fA-F]+)?([pP][-+]?[0-9]+)?`

  If the string does not match any of the above, this function fails. The
  result is an integer if `text` contains no decimal point and the value is
  representable as an integer, and is a real number otherwise.

* Returns the numeric value converted from `text`.

* Throws an exception on failure.

### `std.numeric.pack_i8(values)`

  indention following a line break; if `indent` is specified as a positive
  integer, it is clamped between `1` and `10` inclusively and this function
  behaves as if a string of this number of spaces was set. If `indent` is an
  empty string or zero, or is absent, no indention or line break will be
  inserted.  If `json5` is set to `true`, the [JSON5](https://json5.org/)
  alternative format is used.

* Throws an exception if standard output is binary-oriented, or if source
  data cannot be converted to a valid UTF code point sequence, or if a write
  error occurs.

### `std.io.read([limit])`

* Reads a series of bytes from standard input. If `limit` is set, no more
  than this number of bytes will be read.

* Returns the bytes that have been read as a string. If the end of input is
  encountered, `null` is returned.

* Throws an exception if standard input is text-oriented, or if a read error
  occurs, or if source data cannot be converted to a valid UTF code point
  sequence.

### `std.io.write(data)`

* Writes a series of bytes to standard output. `data` shall be a byte string.

* Returns the number of bytes that have been written.

* Throws an exception if standard output is text-oriented, or if a write
  error occurs.

### `std.io.flush()`

* Forces buffered data on standard output to be delivered to its underlying
  device. This function may be called regardless of the orientation of
  standard output.

* Throws an exception if a write error occurs.

## `std.zlib`

### `std.zlib.Deflator(format, [level])`

* Creates a data compressor using the deflate algorithm according to [RFC
  1951](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951.html). `format` must be one of
  `"deflate"`, `"gzip"`, or `"raw"`. `level` specifies the compression level,
  which must be an integer between 0 and 9. If it is absent, the library
  default value is used.

* Returns a compressor as an object consisting of the following members:

  * `output`
  * `update(data)`
  * `flush()`
  * `finish()`
  * `clear()`

  The string `output` is where compressed data will be appended. The function
  `update()` puts data into the compressor, which shall be a byte string. The
  function `flush()` causes pending bits to be pushed into the output string
  and aligned on a byte boundary. The `finish()` function marks the end of
  input data and returns a copy of the output string. The function `clear()`
  discards both input and output data and resets the compressor to its
  initial state.

* Throws an exception if `format` is invalid or `level` is out of range.

### `std.zlib.deflate(data, [level])`

* Compresses `data` which must be a byte string, as if by

  ```
  std.zlib.deflate = func(data, level) {
    var r = this.Deflator("deflate", level);
    r.update(data);
    return r.finish();
  };
  ```

* Returns the compressed string.

* Throws an exception if `level` is out of range.

### `std.zlib.gzip(data, [level])`

* Compresses `data` which must be a byte string, as if by

  ```
  std.zlib.deflate = func(data, level) {
    var r = this.Deflator("gzip", level);
    r.update(data);
    return r.finish();
  };
  ```

* Returns the compressed string.

* Throws an exception if `level` is out of range.

### `std.zlib.Inflator(format)`

* Creates a data decompressor which uses the deflate algorithm according to
  [RFC 1951](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1951.html). `format` must be
  one of `"deflate"`, `"gzip"`,  or `"raw"`.

* Returns a decompressor as an object consisting of the following members:

  * `output`
  * `update(data)`
  * `flush()`
  * `finish()`
  * `clear()`

  The string `output` is where decompressed data will be pushed. The function
  `update()` puts data into the decompressor, which shall be a byte string.
  The function `flush()` causes pending decompressed bytes to be appended to
  the output string. The `finish()` function marks the end of input data and
  returns a copy of the output string. The function `clear()` discards both
  input and output data and then resets the decompressor to its initial
  state.

* Throws an exception if `format` is invalid.

### `std.zlib.inflate(data)`

* Decompresses `data` which must be a byte string, as if by

  ```
  std.zlib.inflate = func(data) {
    var r = this.Inflator("deflate");
    r.update(data);
    return r.finish();
  };
  ```

* Returns the decompressed string.

* Throws an exception in case of corrupt input data.

### `std.zlib.gunzip(data)`

* Decompresses `data` which must be a byte string, as if by

  ```
  std.zlib.gunzip = func(data) {
    var r = this.Inflator("gzip");
    r.update(data);
    return r.finish();
  };
  ```

* Returns the decompressed string.

* Throws an exception in case of corrupt input data.
