`std.debug.print([args...])`

	* Prints all `args` to the standard error stream, separated by
	  spaces. A line break is appended to terminate the line.

	* Returns `true` if the operation succeeds; otherwise `null`.

`std.debug.dump(value, [indent_increment])`

	* Prints the value to the standard error stream with detailed
	  information. `indent_increment` specifies the number of spaces
	  used as a single level of indent. Its value is clamped between
	  `0` and `10` inclusively. If it is set to `0`, no line break is
	  inserted and output lines are not indented. It has a default
	  value of `2`.

	* Returns `true` if the operation succeeds; otherwise `null`.

`std.chrono.utc_now()`

	* Retrieves the wall clock time in UTC.

	* Returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch,
	  represented as an `integer`.

`std.chrono.local_now()`

	* Retrieves the wall clock time in the local time zone.

	* Returns the number of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00`
	  in the local time zone, represented as an `integer`.

`std.chrono.hires_now()`

	* Retrieves a time point from a high resolution clock. The clock
	  goes monotonically and cannot be adjusted, being suitable for
	  time measurement. This function provides accuracy and might be
	  quite heavyweight.

	* Returns the number of milliseconds since an unspecified time
	  point, represented as a `real`.

`std.chrono.steady_now()`

	* Retrieves a time point from a steady clock. The clock goes
	  monotonically and cannot be adjusted, being suitable for time
	  measurement. This function is supposed to be fast and might
	  have poor accuracy.

	* Returns the number of milliseconds since an unspecified time
	  point, represented as an `integer`.

`std.chrono.local_from_utc(time_utc)`

	* Converts a UTC time point to a local one. `time_utc` shall be
	  the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch.

	* Returns the number of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00`
	  in the local time zone, represented as an `integer`.

`std.chrono.utc_from_local(time_local)`

	* Converts a local time point to a UTC one. `time_local` shall
	  be the number of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00` in
	  the local time zone.

	* Returns the number of milliseconds since the Unix epoch,
	  represented as an `integer`.

`std.chrono.parse_datetime(time_str)`

	* Parses `time_str`, which is an ASCII string representing a time
	  point in the format `1970-01-01 00:00:00.000`, according to the
	  ISO 8601 standard; the subsecond part is optional and may have
	  fewer or more digits. There shall be no leading or trailing
	  spaces.

	* Returns the number of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00`
	  if the time string has been parsed successfully; otherwise
	  `null`.

`std.chrono.format_datetime(time_point, [with_ms])`

	* Converts `time_point`, which represents the number of
	  milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00`, to an ASCII string in
	  the aforementioned format, according to the ISO 8601 standard.
	  If `with_ms` is set to `true`, the string will have a 3-digit
	  fractional part. By default, no fractional part is added.

	* Returns a `string` representing the time point.

`std.chrono.min_datetime([with_ms])`

	* Gets the special string that denotes the negative infinity time
	  point. Calling this function has the same effect with calling
	  `format_datetime()` with the `time_point` argument set to
	  `-0x8000000000000000`.

	* Returns the string `'1601-01-01 00:00:00'` or the string
	  `'1601-01-01 00:00:00.000'` according to `with_ms`.

`std.chrono.max_datetime([with_ms])`

	* Gets the special string that denotes the positive infinity time
	  point. Calling this function has the same effect with calling
	  `format_datetime()` with the `time_point` argument set to
	  `0x7FFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`.

	* Returns the string `'9999-01-01 00:00:00'` or the string
	  `'9999-01-01 00:00:00.000'` according to `with_ms`.
