### `std.debug`

`std.debug.print(...)`

	* Prints all arguments to the standard error stream, separated by

	  point, represented as an `integer`.

	  the aforementioned format, according to the ISO 8601 standard.
	  If `with_ms` is set to `true`, the string will have a 3-digit
	  fractional part. By default, no fractional part is added.

	* Returns a `string` representing the time point.

`std.chrono.datetime_min([with_ms])`

	* Gets the special string that denotes the negative infinity time
	  point. Calling this function has the same effect as calling
	  `datetime_format(-0x8000000000000000, with_ms)`.

	* Returns `'1601-01-01 00:00:00'` or `'1601-01-01 00:00:00.000'`
	  according to `with_ms`.

`std.chrono.datetime_max([with_ms])`

	  fewer or more digits. There shall be no leading or trailing
	  spaces.

	* Returns the number of milliseconds since `1970-01-01 00:00:00`
	  if the time string has been parsed successfully; otherwise
	  `null`.

### `std.string`

`std.string.substr(text, from, [length])`

	* Copies a subrange of `text` to create a new byte string. Bytes
	  are copied from `from` if it is non-negative, and from
	  `lengthof(text) + from` otherwise. If `length` is set to an
	  `integer`, no more than this number of bytes will be copied. If
	  it is absent, all bytes from `from` to the end of `text` will
	  be copied. If `from` is outside `text`, an empty `string` is
	  returned.

	* Returns the specified substring of `text`.

`std.string.replace_substr(text, from, replacement)`

	* Replaces all bytes from `from` to the end of `text` with
	  `replacement` and returns the new byte string. If `from` is

	  negative, it specifies an offset from the end of `text`. If
	  `length` is set to an `integer`, no more than this number of
	  bytes will be copied. If it is `null`, this function is
	  equivalent to `replace_substr(text, from, replacement)`. This
	  function returns a new `string` without modifying `text`.

	* Returns a `string` with the subrange replaced.

`std.string.compare(text1, text2, [length])`

	* Performs lexicographical comparison on two byte strings. If
	  `length` is set to an `integer`, no more than this number of
	  bytes are compared. This function behaves like the `strncmp()`
	  function in C, except that null characters do not terminate
	  strings.

	* Returns a positive `integer` if `text1` compares greater than
	  `text2`, a negative `integer` if `text1` compares less than
	  `text2`, or zero if `text1` compares equal to `text2`.

`std.string.starts_with(text, prefix)`

	* Checks whether `prefix` is a prefix of `text`. The empty
	  `string` is considered to be a prefix of any string.

	  `null`.
