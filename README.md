# The Asteria Programming Language

1. Sane and clean.
2. Self-consistent.
3. Simple to use.
4. Lightweight.
5. Procedural.
6. Easy to intergrate in a C++ project. (C++11 is required.)
7. Native to C++ exceptions, particularly `std::bad_alloc`.

# Characteristics

1. First-class functions.
2. Closure functions (`lambda` expressions).
3. Exceptions.
4. Deterministic cleanup functions (`defer` statements).
5. Flexible syntax similar to C++ and JavaScript.
6. Regular grammar.
7. Passing by reference only, including the operand of a `throw` statement and the return value of a function.
8. Explicit deep copying (an object is deep copied if and only if the `=` operator is used).
