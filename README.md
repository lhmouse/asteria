# Concepts

I started learning programming from **ActionScript** since **Flash 5** days. It was no sooner (and not strange, either) than I learned **JavaScript**, because they are so similar. I admit that **JavaScript** is a fascinating language, but it also has quite a few drawbacks when we look at it today:

1. There is no 64-bit integer type. While some data exchange formats (such as **Protocol Buffers**) do have 64-bit integers, they cannot be stored as `Number`s safely. Some implementations split 64-bit integers into higher and lower parts, which is not very handy, as the lower part suddenly becomes signed and may be negative.
2. There are no binary strings. `String`s are in **UCS-2** (rather than **UTF-16**), while `ArrayBuffer`s are not resizable.
3. `NaN` and `Infinity` are neither keywords nor constants. They are properties of the global object and may be overwritten. Moreover, `Boolean(NaN)` yields `false` unlike other languages.

Here is an issue that is shared by almost all common languages, including **C** and **Python**:

```javascript
let a = [ ];
let b = [ ];

function test(x, y) {
  x.length = 0, x[0] = "hello";  // modifies the array that `x` would reference
  y = [ "hello" ];               // modifies `y` instead of the argument
}
test(a, b);  // arguments are in effect pointers

console.log("a = ", a);   // [ 'hello' ]
console.log("b = ", b);   // []
```

However, compared with typed languages such as **Java**, **JavaScript** has a few advantages:

1. A number is always a `Number`. There are no integer types of varieties of widths, which simplifies programming. Unlike integers, `Number`s never overflow.
2. Being untyped, a function can be passed around like objects without knowing its parameters.

**Asteria** has been highly inspired by **JavaScript** but has been designed to address such issues.

# Features

1. Sane and clean.
2. Self-consistent.
3. Simple to use.
4. Lightweight.
5. Procedural.
6. Dynamically typed.
7. Easy to integrate in a C++ project. (C++17 hexadecimal floating-point literals are required.)
8. Native to C++ exceptions, particularly `std::bad_alloc`.

# Characteristics

1. First-class functions.
2. Closure functions.
3. Exceptions.
4. Flexible syntax similar to **C++** and **JavaScript**.
5. Regular grammar.
6. Argument passing (by value or reference) determined by the **argument** rather than the **parameter**.
7. Idempotently copyable values basing on copy-on-write.
8. Minimal garbage collection support.
9. Structured binding similar to **C++17**.

# Data Types

**Asteria** is _untyped_. _Variables_ do not have types. Only _values_ (which can be stored in in variables) do. In this sense functions are considered opaque data.

There are 9 data types:

# Expression Categories

```go
var foo;
// `foo` refers to a "variable" holding `null`.

const inc = 42;
// `inc` refers to an "immutable variable" holding an `integer` of `42`.

var bar = func() { return ->inc;  };      // return by reference
// `bar` refers to an "immutable variable" holding a function.
// `bar()` refers to the same "variable" as `inc`.

func add(x) { return x + inc;  };   // return by value
// `add` refers to an "immutable variable" holding a function.
// `add(5)` refers to a "temporary" holding an `integer` of `47`.
```
