# The Asteria Programming Language

1. Sane and clean.
2. Self-consistent.
3. Simple to use.
4. Lightweight.
5. Procedural.
6. Dynamically typed.
7. Easy to integrate in a C++ project. (C++14 is required.)
8. Native to C++ exceptions, particularly `std::bad_alloc`.

# Characteristics

1. First-class functions.
2. Closure functions (lambda expressions).
3. Exceptions.
4. Flexible syntax similar to **C++** and **JavaScript**.
5. Regular grammar.
6. Pass-by-reference function arguments.  
Return values are passed by value by default, but can also be passed by reference using the `return&` syntax.
7. Minimal garbage collection support.  
Objects are managed using referencing counting. Primitive types are copy-on-write hence circular references are impossible.
